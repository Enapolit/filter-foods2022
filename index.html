        <h1>Gowanus Before and After the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan</h1>
        <p>In November, City Council approved the Gowanus Neighborhood Plan, an expansive rezoning project that will transform the neighborhood surrounding Brooklyn’s infamous sludge-infested waters into the Venice of Brooklyn.</p> 

<p>The approval was a dream come true for developers in the region; and this spring, that dream will become a reality.</p> 

<p>The first phase of the radical rezoning will begin next week as workers demolish existing structures around the Gowanus Canal to make room for new commercial and residential spaces.</p>  

<p>The project will bring thousands of affordable housing units, mixed-use commercial and industrial and artist spaces, as well as new sewer, school, transit, and park infrastructure to the shores of the Gowanus Canal by 2035. The centerpiece of the plan is Gowanus Green, a residential corridor composed of 8,500 new homes, including 3,000 permanently affordable homes reserved for low-income and working-class families through the Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (MIH) initiative.</p>
        
        <p>Designers at SCAPE have created renderings of the project's goals to help Gowanus residents visualize some of the changes that are coming to their neighborhood over the next two decades. </p>

        <p>Use the dropdown menu below to compare pictures of how Gowanus is expected to look before and after the rezoning.</p>
